# AI/DL/ML/NLP/CV Conference Cheatsheet


## The Go-To Choice 2021
- See <a href="https://research.com/">Research.com</a>
    - Shows conference ranking, deadline, location, date, and other important conference-related info in a very organized manner.


## Conference Ranking/Reputation
### General
- See <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~zaiane/htmldocs/ConfRanking.html#2">Computer Science Conference Rankings</a>
    - A little outdated list of conference tiers. But covers all fields of Computer Science.
- See <a href="https://www.aminer.org/ranks/conf?category=All&category_en=All&category_type=ccf">Computer Science Conference(Journal) Rank: - AMiner</a>
    - A modern version of the one above. A general ranking tool with explanations on how the rankings are made.
    - In truth, I'd rather use google scholar metrics.

### AI/DL/ML Conferences
- Read <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_artificialintelligence">Artificial Intelligence - Google Scholar Metrics</a>
    - NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR are the kings when it comes to theoretical Deep Learning/Machine Learning. See no other venue.
    - ICLR has not been around for very long but really made its mark over the last few years.
    - Whereas AAAI and IJCNLP take a wider perspective on Artificial Intelligence, including application papers. Their Interested topics could include NLP and CV.

### CV Conferences
- Read <a href="https://deepomatic.com/en/top-6-computer-vision-conferences-around-the-world">Top 6 Computer Vision Conferences - Deepomatic</a>
    - This article is mostly it for those in CV. But it lacks detail.
- Read <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-mainstream-computer-vision-people-ignore-the-papers-that-are-not-published-in-CVPR-ECCV-ICCV-Do-these-papers-have-zero-value-to-the-community">Do "mainstream" computer vision people ignore the papers that are not published in CVPR/ECCV/ICCV? Do these papers have zero value to the community?</a>
    - Read Dr. Zeeshan Zia's answer. Shows why you need to publish at an important, popular, and top-ranked venue.

### NLP Conferences
- Read <a href="https://www.junglelightspeed.com/the-top-10-nlp-conferences/">The Top 10 NLP Conferences | jungle light speed</a>
    - Written by Dr. Robert Munro Monarch, a quite known expert in Computational Linguistics.
    - Even though the famous article is a little harsh to some good NLP workshops, it serves as a good introduction to the newcomers.
- See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_computationallinguistics">Computational Linguistics - Google Scholar Metrics</a>
    - For those who prefer simplistic quantitative ranking 1.
    - I'd say all those in top 20 are good venues for publications.
    - As statistics show, solid workshops like SemEval (International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation), WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation), BEA (Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications) are much better than other crappy conferences.
- See <a href="https://aclanthology.org/">ACL Anthology</a>
    - Sometimes the organizers know the best. It is safe to say that all events listed separatedly under "ACL Events" carry some significance within the NLP community.


## Conference Deadlines
- See <a href="https://aideadlin.es/?sub=ML,CV,NLP,RO,SP,DM">AI Conference Deadlines</a>
    - Helped a lot in my research career. The website lacks showing the conferences that are further away. 
    - But it is a powerful tool when searching for those last-minut upcoming deadlines.


## Creating Figures
### Choosing Figure Colors
- Read <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rth2.12308">Choosing color palettes for scientific figures</a>
    - This is a journal paper published in RPTH journal, by Wiley. Gives a good introduction to choosing colors using color wheel, a skill that can be used right away.
### Make MatPlotLib Figures Look Better
- Read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24547047/how-to-make-matplotlib-graphs-look-professionally-done-like-this">How to make matplotlib graphs look professionally done like this?</a>
    - The long answer by DrV captures it all.
